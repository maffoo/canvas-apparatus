Canvas Apparatus
================

By Matthew Neeley, inspired by Robert Howsare's work "Drawing Apparatus" (http://roberthowsare.com/rational-aesthetics/drawing-apparatus/) and Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" (http://vimeo.com/36579366).

My first project using Ember.js (http://emberjs.com) and Play framework 2.0 (http://www.playframework.org), made while trying to learn a little about using these two awesome projects.
