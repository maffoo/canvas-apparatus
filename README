Canvas Apparatus
=====================================

By Matthew Neeley, inspired by Robert Howsare's work "Drawing Apparatus"
(http://roberthowsare.com/rational-aesthetics/drawing-apparatus/) and
Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" (http://vimeo.com/36579366).

My first project using Ember.js (http://emberjs.com) and Play framework 2.0
(http://www.playframework.org), made while trying to learn a little about
using these two awesome projects.
