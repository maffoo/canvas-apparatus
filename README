This is your new Play 2.0 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

TODO:
- detect fast pen motions and subdivide them to make the drawing smooth
- "fade out" old drawings
- optimize to speed up rendering of drawings (maybe render in background workers)
- "gallery" where users can submit drawings
